# Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis, essentially takes as input, the original dimensions, i.e. the m independent variables originally defined and then produces as output p new variables or dimensions. These are new extracted independent variables are the ones that explain the most variance of the dataset regardless of the dependent variables. The fact that we consider PCA as an unsupervised learning model, is the fact that it does not consider the dependent variable in the final model that it builds.
