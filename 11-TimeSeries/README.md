# Time Series

Any data recorded at fixed interval of time over a certain period of time, is called time series. It is a stochastic process, i.e. the values are dependent on, and change with time. There are special techniques that are used for tackling such models.

This chapter contains the following topics:

1. [Introduction](./01-Introduction.md)
2. [Implementation in R](./01-TimeSeriesInR.md)
3. Implementation in Python
